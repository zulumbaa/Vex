# Vex (Work in Progress)

**Vex** is a 2D top-down action-adventure game developed in Unity.  
The game is currently in development and aims to deliver a story-driven arcade experience with combat mechanics, interactable items, and NPCs.

This repository contains the early stages of the project â€” featuring movement, basic environment setup, and game architecture groundwork.
